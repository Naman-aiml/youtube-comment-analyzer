@garyfrancis6193,Ay yes. In college in 1978 I rented a room in a big old two story house downtown. It had enough rooms to rent out two more upstairs and landlady lived at the back on the first floor. She was Latvian and didn’t speak much English and by then had retired as part of the cleaning staff at the General hospital. She told me once she had bought the house in 1952 for $7000 and paid it off in 5 years. That house is still there but she is gone as she was about 70 in 1978. Now $7000 would  be your monthly mortgage payment.  It’s not that prices went up. The value of your money has decreased since 1952 by 80%. What would have cost $1 in 1952 costs $20 now and rising as your dollar keeps shrinking in value to nothing. What it amounts to is that you likely worked to get that money that is becoming more worthless every day. You can’t take back your labour so you are basically being robbed of its past value until you have nothing. In the past people bought real estate to hedge their savings against inflation and live in it too. But taxes on it and insurance kept rising and house prices kept rising relative to incomes until it is increasingly unaffordable to more and more people. That means of preserving the value of their savings is now unavailable as their money keeps dropping in value. Now big business is looking at replacing hundreds of thousands or millions of workers with AI and robots. So you won’t have income anymore. Forget about UBI. No one will be paying income tax because they will have no jobs. Where would UBI money come from? That’s the future you are facing now.

They were hiring younger workers at lower pay. Life was never again the same for us. You can only say the economy was great in 70s unless you lived through them.

@Nuonerew,"Yes, the citizens of the USA bear the cost of US government subsidies. 
Here's how:
Taxpayer Funding: Government subsidies are funded by taxpayer money, collected through various forms of taxation. In effect, citizens' tax payments contribute to the resources that are then allocated as subsidies.
Borrowing: If a subsidy program is financed through government borrowing, the costs are borne by future taxpayers, including the interest payments associated with the debt.
Economic Impact: The act of funding subsidies through taxes or borrowing can have negative economic effects on individuals and businesses, impacting their working, investing, and entrepreneurial activities. 
In essence, citizens, as taxpayers, ultimately provide the funds for government subsidies, and their economic activities can be affected by the costs and potential economic distortions associated with these programs.",2025-06-24T02:52:04Z,0,-0.2732,0.042,0.9,0.058

@HichigoShirosaki1,"This doesn't pinpoint the exact time the graphs diverge at which point is the root cause, which would show how to reverse it. What I can say, though, is that automation, telecommunications, women in the workforce, and the baby boom are the primary causes because more workers, whether automated, outsourced, or adding more people to the workforce, mean more supply mean less pay per person and not everyone was in a household with another person to mitigate that. Simply put, productivity mainly benefits the rich because they make more profit the more goods their businesses move which is the exact sane concept as gdp. VOLUME = $$$. That is basic business economics. When they could only choose from suitable men to do jobs and can't outsource to somewhere cheaper, take the men out of the equation through automation, and can't decide to just hire a woman, they don't have leverage for cheaper labor. That is part of why tarrifs are actually a solid idea to mitigate some of it.

 There are several graphs you could have shown to better analyze the issue that goes over the actual economics involved. This video sounds more like an overview rather than an actual analysis, which is needed to really answer the question.

@theregularviking-eg2od,"It's interesting to note that the 1960's wasn't investigated more fully. The cultural revolution, JFK's assassination, and LBJ's Social Security Amendments act all were huge contributors to the economic quagmire we live in today. To my mind, this decade set the stage for things like Enron, Bernie Madoff, and a ton of others that I'm not mentioning or have yet to be caught. I understand that it's a cultural tightrope to walk this line, but maybe everyone is wrong. In the 1950's, blacks from the West Indies were doing fantastic (and still are). Quite frankly (not to sound too ethereal) I think it goes back to Magna Carta. If everyone is subject to the law (including the King or what have you), then what has been done since... a while ago (I'm not going there as it would take too long) is to just make so many laws, amendments, etc. that the definition of what the law defines is so muddied that it could mean anything.

@colinfountain59,"There are a number of factors this does not consider. If all the wealth of the top income earners was distributed tot he low and median income earners, how much difference would it actually make to their incomes? We have to keep in mind that the percentage of people in the high income category is very small so once this money is divided up to so many, it likely isn't going to make a lot of difference. Also the definition of productivity needs to be looked at. In a service based economy, most supposed productivity is just paper shuffling that doesn't actually produce any real wealth. It doesn't build houses, cars or furniture or provide us with health that we consider our most cherished possessions.",2025-06-23T23:08:25Z,0,0.8748,0.1,0.884,0.016
